        <h1>Oranges Sushi & Noodles - A Delightful Experience</h1>
        <p><strong>Visited on:</strong> February 23rd (Sunday)</p>
        <p><strong>Location:</strong> Issaquah, Washington</p>
        <p><strong>Google Rating:</strong> 4.5 stars (988 reviews)</p>

        <h2>First Impressions</h2>
        <p>We visited <span class="highlight">Oranges Sushi & Noodles</span> based on a friend's recommendation. They praised the vegetarian sushi and ramen, so we decided to check it out. The drive was pleasant, but Google Maps directed us to the back of the restaurant. Fortunately, an employee noticed us and let us in. If you're visiting, make sure to enter through the <span class="highlight">parking lot entrance</span>, not the street-side entrance.</p>

        <h2>Ambiance & Seating</h2>
        <p>The moment we stepped in, we were welcomed warmly by the staff. The restaurant had a lively atmosphere, and seating was spacious, with around 10 to 15 tables spread across two rooms. Surprisingly, despite being a Sunday, there was <span class="highlight">no wait time</span>, and we were seated immediately.</p>

        <h2>Menu & Ordering</h2>
        <p>The menu had an extensive selection, including appetizers, rice bowls, udon, cold plates, ramen, and sushi. As vegetarians, we had two ramen options: <span class="highlight">Veggie Tantan</span> and <span class="highlight">Miso Veggie Ramen</span>. We opted for the <strong>Veggie Tantan</strong>, a vegetable broth infused with Asian spices, thick noodles, and fresh toppings like mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and scallions.</p>
        <p>For sushi, we chose the <span class="highlight">Green Dragon Roll</span>, which featured green beans, pickled veggies, cucumber, and mango, topped with avocado. The waitress was very helpful and even suggested <span class="highlight">share bowls</span> for the ramen, which made our dining experience even better.</p>

        <h2>Food Experience</h2>
        <p>We expected a longer wait time, but our food arrived in just <span class="highlight">one to two minutes</span>! The sushi looked stunning, and the ramen was steaming hot.</p>
        <p>The sushi was <span class="highlight">bursting with flavors</span>—the sweetness of mango, tanginess of vinegar, and crunchiness of fresh veggies blended perfectly. It was so good that we finished the eight pieces in just a few minutes!</p>
        <p>The ramen broth was rich and flavorful, packed with a variety of vegetables. The thick noodles were light and easy to eat, and our spice level choice (medium) was just right—not too spicy, yet full of warmth.</p>

        <h2>Dessert - A Heavenly Surprise</h2>
        <p>Though we were quite full, we couldn’t resist trying a dessert. We opted for <span class="highlight">Shu Cream Puffs</span>, which were delicate, cloud-like Japanese cream puffs. These came with <span class="highlight">mango popping boba</span>, creating a delightful contrast of subtle sweetness and tangy bursts.</p>

        <h2>Comparison with Other Ramen Spots</h2>
        <p>Compared to <span class="highlight">Tanoor Ramen</span> in Seattle, where wait times are longer and ramen contains fewer vegetables, Oranges Sushi & Noodles was much faster and had a more vegetable-rich broth. Both are great options, but for a quick and hearty vegetarian ramen, this place stands out.</p>

        <h2>Service & Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Service was quick, almost <span class="highlight">too quick</span>. As soon as we finished eating, the staff swiftly cleared our table and brought the bill, making the experience feel slightly rushed.</p>
        <p>Before leaving, we signed up for their <span class="highlight">rewards program</span>. For every $37.50 spent, you earn $1 back, and they even asked for our birthdays—maybe for a surprise in the future?</p>
        <p>Our total bill (before tips) was around <strong>$40</strong>, making it a great value for the experience. Overall, we’d highly recommend Oranges Sushi & Noodles for its quick service, welcoming atmosphere, and delicious food.</p>
